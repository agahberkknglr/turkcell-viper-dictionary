- VIPER architecture

## Architecture
- The Viper architecture is an open-source toolkit for writing reusable, modular, and scalable applications in Swift, emphasizing separation of concerns through components like View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Routing.
- View: Responsible for presenting data to the user and capturing user interactions, but should not contain business logic.
- Interactor: Contains the business logic and handles data fetching, manipulation, and interaction with the data layer (e.g., APIs, databases).
- Presenter: Acts as a mediator between the view and the interactor, formatting data received from the interactor into a suitable format for display in the view.
- Entity: Represents the basic model object or data structure used by the interactor and presenter.
- Routing: Handles navigation between different modules (VIPER components), typically through segues or other navigation mechanisms.
